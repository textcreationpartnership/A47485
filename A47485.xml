            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ONE of the Principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that induc'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to publiſh the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account, was to raiſe his Fellow-Subjects into a Belief, That beſides our falſe Friends, our Enemies are ſtill ſo many, reſtleſs and deſigning, That we ought not, all of a ſudden,
<pb facs="tcp:101173:3"/>to grow ſo ſecure, as voluntarily to drop the Sword out of our Hands, till we ſee more weighty Reaſons for diſarming our ſelves, than thoſe which contributed to our first Equipping: <hi>Leaſt we thereby make too dangerous an Experiment of our Enemies Virtue, by putting it too much in their Power to annoy us. England</hi> is yet but in the Dawning of a PEACE, and being <hi>a deſireable Land,</hi> it can never expect Security from any Thing but an equal Force with our Neighbours; for if we cannot reſiſt them by our <hi>Arms,</hi> 'tis in vain to dream of any other Means of our <hi>PRESERVATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Deſign is to vindicate the Government from the vile Asperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caſt upon it by the avow'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Religion and Liberties, I mean the Adherents to the late
<pb facs="tcp:101173:3"/>King; for as all their Writers have had the Inſolence and Vanity to charge our Government with inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sham-Plots, and think under thoſe ungrateful <hi>Calumnies</hi> to ſkreen themſelves from the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Guilt of their <hi>Barbarous Conſpiracies;</hi> ſo I thought my ſelf oblig'd to lay open the Falſhood of theſe Suggeſtions, and to ſet every thing in its proper LIGHT, that the abus'd Multitude may ſee Things, <hi>as they really are, or have been,</hi> and not as the Enemies of our QUIET have falſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them.</p>
            <p>In this Undertaking I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, That neither the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of expreſſing my Gratitude to <hi>the beſt of Kings,</hi> and the moſt <hi>regular</hi> Eſtabliſhment in the World, the Hopes of a future Reward, nor the Advantage of revenging
<pb facs="tcp:101173:4"/>former Piques (the common Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt all that write for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) hath influenc'd me in the leaſt to deviate from what I ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <hi>TRUTH.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that this is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouſly aſſerted, I have, after the Example of ſome of the moſt Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Hiſtorians of this and the laſt Age, cited my Authorities all along in the <hi>Margin,</hi> which are Printed at large in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> and thoſe the Reader may conſult at Leiſure for his farther Satisfaction; So that all the Buſineſs I had to do, was but to digeſt theſe Materials into a proper Method, according to the Series of Time, when the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Incidents happen'd, and to collect out of them what I thought moſt convenient to be inſerted into the Narration. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101173:4"/>As the Author lay under no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to diſguiſe or perplex the TRUTH, much leſs to ſacrifice it to any private Reſentment; ſo he has all along taken Care to expreſs himſelf in ſuch a plain, familiar Stile, as is the Language of Buſineſs, and lies within the Reach of the meanest Capacity.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Maimbourg, Varillas</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians, <hi>who have been dabling in our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Affairs;</hi> and whoſe Buſineſs it was, not ſo much to inſtruct the Readers Underſtanding as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon his Paſſions, have indeed obſerv'd another Conduct: Their Periods are very Harmonious, and the Turn of their Language exceeding beautiful; but ſtill a Snake lies under their <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Flowers: for as it was not their Deſign (as I intimated before) to
<pb facs="tcp:101173:5"/>confine themſelves to the Severity of <hi>TRUTH,</hi> which does not require any ſuch Artifices to recommend it; ſo they fondly thought to conceal and ſupply the Defect of it by the Elegance of their Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The Reflections I have taken the Liberty ſometimes to incorporate with the Narration are juſt and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch as properly ariſe from the Matter of Fact, and upon this Head I cannot forbear to acquaint my Reader, that it was not without ſome Regret, that I found my ſelf oblig'd to the neceſſity of making them: For as my Zeal to my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country forc'd me to diſplay the Unnatural Betrayers of it in their proper Colours; ſo I could heartily wiſh for the <hi>HONOUR</hi> of it, that it had never produc'd
<pb facs="tcp:101173:5"/>ſuch a Sort of deteſtable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis no Wonder at all, That <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould endeavour the Re-eſtabliſhment of a PRINCE, who had given the World ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proofs of his <hi>Biggotry</hi> to their Church: Nor was I ſurpriz'd to find Men of <hi>broken</hi> Fortunes to Herd with them, and Declare for them; for theſe might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flatter themſelves to make a better Figure in the World upon another <hi>REVOLUTION;</hi> at leaſt they could not find themſelves in worſe Circumſtances than what they labour under at preſent; but that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Men of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in the nefarious Deſign of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing an execrable Servitude upon themſelves and their Posterity, or that any who call themſelves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101173:6"/>ſhould intereſt themſelves in a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's</hi> Quarrel, who in the little time he reign'd over us, ſo ill requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for their Fidelity and Zeal, is a Prodigy, for ought I know, not to be match'd in Hiſtory; and <hi>Livy,</hi> who is tedious to a <hi>Fault,</hi> in recounting unnatural <hi>Phaenomenas,</hi> has nothing to equal it.</p>
            <p>I am of Opinion, That he who ſaves a Profeſs'd Enemy againſt his Will, and puts him into a Capacity of Deſtroying his Benefactor, has a greater Meaſure of Charity than Diſcretion, and may be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Number of thoſe we call <hi>Felo's de ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Invitum qui ſervat, idem facit occidenti.</q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101173:6"/>Now the late King had given us ſuch Notorious Indications of his <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to our <hi>Religion,</hi> and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſign'd to live under a <hi>limited Conſtitution,</hi> as ours is; by tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet, by violating the moſt <hi>Sacred Oaths,</hi> and aſſuming an <hi>Arbitrary Deſpotical Power,</hi> that I wonder we ſhould have ſo many weak headed Men amongſt us, that would hazard their Lives to reſtore him to Three Crowns, that he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily threw away, <hi>&amp; gayeté de Ceur.</hi> 'Tis true;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were reduced to the laſt Extremities in the Wilderneſs, longed for the <hi>Onyons</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but 'tis no where intimated, that they were fond of <hi>Returning</hi> to the <hi>Vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi> of <hi>Making Bricks</hi> under their <hi>cruel Task-Maſters,</hi> or that

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101173:9"/>of them, will be equally uſeful, and acceptable, to the Public, and becauſe the <hi>Lancaſhire Plot</hi> has had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not only to be the <hi>Parent,</hi> but <hi>Companion</hi> of all the other Conſpiracies, I find my ſelf oblig'd to begin, tho' the Series of the Narration will not permit me to conclude with it.</p>
            <p>The Contrivance then of this Plot is owing to the Politics of the late <hi>King James;</hi> who finding himſelf ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt in the love and affections of his People, and the Crown fallen from his Head by his own mal-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, yet flattering himſelf with the vain hopes of regaining by the Sword, what he had forfeited by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Laws of the Land, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſubvert the Conſtitution: He fled into <hi>France</hi> for ſhelter till he could put his Affairs into ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as might facilitate his Return, and enable him to eſtabliſh <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power</hi> in theſe Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>But before he took his Voyage for <hi>France</hi> to gain Aſſiſtance from that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Monarch, 'twas concerted by him and thoſe Popiſh bigotted Friends, that had eſpous'd his Intereſt, that they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101173:9"/>ſhould alſo endeavour at the ſame time to raiſe a <hi>Ferment</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to concur with the Deſigns that carryed him into <hi>France,</hi> and therefore that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of known Experience, Courage and Secreſy ſhould be diſpatch'd on that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to imbroyl the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bromfeild,</hi> a pretended <hi>Quaker,</hi> and ſo dexterous and bold a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, that he was able to perſonate the the Diſciple of any <hi>Sect,</hi> Member of any <hi>Faction,</hi> or Perſon of any <hi>Quality,</hi> had this Office aſſign'd him, and from the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Salisbury's</hi> by the Name of <hi>Thompſon</hi> advanc'd towards <hi>Scotland:</hi> Not forgetting (according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given him by the late King) to ſow ſuch Seeds of Diſcontent and Jealouſy as he paſs'd through the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as might ripen into an <hi>Inſurrection</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>He had not been long in <hi>Scotland</hi> before he effected his wicked Purpoſes, in laying a Foundation for a Civil War in that Kingdom, and from thence ſail'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> on the ſame Errand: Where he acquaints the Earl
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101173:10"/>of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> how ſucceſsful he had been in his Negotiations in <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> That the <hi>Duke of Gourdon</hi> had garriſon'd <hi>Edenbrough Caſtle,</hi> and that the <hi>Viſcount Dundee</hi> would be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Head of a great Army there, and both declare for the late King <hi>James;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Bromfeild</hi> finding the <hi>Earl of Tyrconnel,</hi> ſo zealous for the Cauſe, that he wanted no Arguments or Preſwaſions, to make him more active and daring, in promoting the late Kings Service; he ſail'd from thence into <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> where he might be more uſeful; intending to make <hi>that</hi> and the adjacent Countrys the Provinces he would act in.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Bromfeild</hi> landed in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> he intended for <hi>Croxteth,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Lord Molineux;</hi> but for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much obſerv'd there, he alter'd his purpoſe, and took up his head quarters at Mr. <hi>Fitz Herberts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra</hi>

            <p>From <hi>Wapra</hi> he often made Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into the neighbouring Countys,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101173:10"/>and through by-ways to <hi>Croxteth</hi> to confer with the <hi>Lord Molineux,</hi> and his Son, and other conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Roman Character.</hi> And having adjuſted Matters there for an <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> he return'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> with his Diſpatches, and ſo backward and forward, as the Emergency of his treaſonable Affairs requir'd.

            <p>If any object that <hi>Bromfeild</hi>'s Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>Scotland</hi> has no Authorities to ſupport it, let the Reader know, 'tis not for want of them they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101173:11"/>but for prudential Reaſons 'tis thought fit to conceal them at preſent, there being other and farther Uſes to be made of them by the Government here after at his Tryal, whenſoever he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Juſtice. However that I may not be thought to impoſe upon my Reader, if Mr. <hi>Bromfeild</hi> be told, that the Proof of that Matter is contain'd in the <hi>Papers</hi> under his own hand, which he ſent out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Carver,</hi> I am almoſt confident he will not deny it. I equally abhor a falſe and partial Author; but Mr. <hi>Bromfeild</hi>'s Crimes are of themſelves ſo heinous and execrable that his Hiſtorian need not give himſelf the Trouble to add to their Blackneſs, therefore I have rather <hi>abbreviated</hi> than <hi>inlarg'd</hi> the Share he had in the Plot, and made no other uſe of him, but what ſerves to trace the Conſpiracy from its <hi>dark Original</hi> at the late Kings going off, and lets the Readers into the Methods that <hi>began</hi> the Treaſonable Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies.</p>

            <p>This early and open Deſign againſt their Majeſties, and the Government, making no ſmall Noiſe in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> the Matter came alſo to be examin'd at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> by the then <hi>Earl,</hi> now <hi>his Grace the Duke of</hi> Devonſhire, the now <hi>Earl of</hi> Macclesfeild, <hi>the Earl of</hi> Scarbrough <hi>and the Lord</hi> Wharton. All theſe noble <hi>Peers</hi> being at that time in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to view and regulate the Army. And their Lordſhips all agreed that the <hi>Earl of</hi> Macclesfeild, <hi>as Lord Leiutenant of that County,</hi> ſhould immediatly iſſue out his Warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lunt</hi> and <hi>Thrillfall,</hi> which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Thus far you have found <hi>Lunt</hi>'s and <hi>Thrillfall's</hi> bringing Commiſſions into <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> from the late King,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101173:16"/>ſubſtantially, and credibly prov'd, and where Intereſt or Prejudice can no way ſuſpect any Colluſion. I ſhall therefore proceed in the next Place to ſhew you how they diſpos'd of 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thrillfall</hi> and <hi>Lunt</hi> having eſcap'd the Officers of the Cuſtoms, they haſten to <hi>Mr.</hi> Tildeſly's <hi>of the Lodge,</hi>

               </note> and there divided their Pacquets. The <hi>Commiſſions</hi> directed to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> &amp;c. were taken Care of by Mr. <hi>Thrillfall:</hi> Who having a Guide provided for him, began his Journey thither, as ſoon as he had refreſh'd himſelf. The reſt of the <hi>Commiſſions</hi> appointed for <hi>Lancaſhire, Cheſhire, Staffordſhire,</hi> &amp;c. were committed to the Care of Mr. <hi>Lunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thrillfall,</hi> purſuant to the late Kings Orders, having delivered his ſhare of the Commiſſions, and what elſe he had in charge to the more <hi>Northren</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; he privately returned to his own Houſe at <hi>Gooſner</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and, having notice there, that his treaſonable Practices were diſcover'd by Mr. <hi>Kelly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodſworth, and the Commiſſions left in the Ship,</hi> he took all imaginable Care to ſecure himſelf there,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101173:16"/>till he could find an Opportunity of returning to the late King in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Deſignincounter'd a ſevere diſappointment, and he with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Treachery. For it being whiſper'd among the Party that he was return'd, it quickly took Air; and a Warrant (as I ſaid before) being out againſt him from the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he was ſought after by a Party of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and found by the Corporal in a hollow Place made for that purpoſe in a Stack of Turffs. As ſoon as he was diſcover'd, the Corporal attempting to ſeize him, <hi>Thrillfall</hi> violently ſnatcheth the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket out of the Corporals hand, and knock'd him down with it; but the Corporal recovering himſelf, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Life,</hi> and the Priſoners <hi>Eſcape</hi> in ſuch apparent Danger, he drew his Sword, <hi>and run Mr.</hi> Thrillfall <hi>through the Body, of which wound he died immediatly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what but the Senſe of his own Guilt, and the Dread of the ſhameful Death, that he knew muſt attend it, could have forc'd him to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Reſiſtance of lawful Authority.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101173:17"/>For tho' we allow him to be a Man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never ſo great Courage, yet we can not ſuppoſe he would have thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Life as he did, if he had not known his Crimes were <hi>ſo great,</hi> and the Proof of 'em <hi>ſo plain,</hi> that 'twas impoſſible for him to eſcape the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> if he ſhould have been apprehended and brought to a Tryal.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101173:19"/>in 1688 and 1689. That they were then modelling of Officers, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to aſſiſt an <hi>Invaſion,</hi> and raiſe a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And were providing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>Scarlet Cloaks, War-Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Swords, Piſtols</hi> and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſits for that bloody Enterpriſe; my next Affairs is to acquaint you by what <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> it was tranſacted, as well as the ſeveral <hi>Diſappointments</hi> that attended it, till it was more fully diſcovered in 1694.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Lunt</hi> having (as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) ſent many Souldiers into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> was returning thither in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Mr. <hi>Abbot then, and now, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Lord Molyneux,</hi> to give an Account to his Maſters of his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations in <hi>London;</hi> but in <hi>Coventry</hi> they were both ſeiz'd and impriſon'd, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Government, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1689.</p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Lunt's</hi> and <hi>Abbot's</hi> Confinement in <hi>Coventry,</hi> Providence ſo order'd it, that <hi>Charles Cawſon,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Veſſel that brought <hi>Lunt</hi> and <hi>Thrillfall</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> was carrying up to <hi>London</hi> a Priſoner for that Fact: And lodging at <hi>Coventry</hi> was told as a piece of News, that two of his Country-Men were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that <hi>Goal</hi> as Enemies to the King and Government. <hi>Cawſon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſee them, the Kings Meſſenger that had <hi>Cawſon</hi> in Cuſtody conſents to it, and walking together into the Priſon, <hi>Cawſon</hi> knows <hi>Lunt</hi> at firſt ſight, <hi>charges him with being one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he brought out of</hi> Ireland <hi>in</hi> June <hi>last, and who brought over the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

And if this and the foregoing Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies do not prove, that <hi>Lunt</hi> was an Agent for the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Papiſts, and his bringing over Commiſſions from the late King, I know not what can.</p>
            <p>Matters appearing ſo plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lunt,</hi> he and <hi>Abbot,</hi> Steward to the Lord <hi>Molyneux,</hi> were removed from <hi>Coventry</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> examin'd by the Privy Council, and both commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Newgate</hi> for <hi>Treaſonable Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, November,</hi> 1689.

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101173:28"/>In <hi>November</hi> 1689, we leſt Mr. <hi>Lunt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where they reinain'd twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weeks, and then were bail'd to appear at the Aſſizes at <hi>Lancaster.

            <p>When the Officers of the Cuſtoms feiz'd the Commiſſions, Declarations and other Papers that <hi>Lunt</hi> left behind him in the Veſſel, they forgot to ſet ſuch a mark upon them before they deliver'd them out of their Hands, as might enable them to know the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers again, when produced, and for want of ſuch Mark, being unable to ſwear 'em to be the very ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, after they had been ſo long out of their Hands; the Government that always expreſs'd an Unwillingneſs to

            <p>Nor was this the only Cauſe of <hi>Lunts</hi> Acquittal, but Mr. <hi>Cawſon</hi> falling ſick a little before the Aſſizes, of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe that carry'd him to his <hi>long Home,</hi> and the Marriners being <hi>all at Sea,</hi> there was now but <hi>one</hi> Witneſs againſt him (<hi>viz</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodſworth</hi>) which is not ſufficient, in a Caſe of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thus <hi>Lunt was diſcharg'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have heard it prov'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Poſſibility of Contradiction, that <hi>Lunt</hi> did bring <hi>Commiſſions</hi> from the late King, that he deliver'd thoſe <hi>Commiſſions</hi> (excepting thoſe few that were loſt) as directed, that he <hi>liſted Souldiers, and bought Arms</hi> for the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Papiſts, that <hi>two</hi> of thoſe <hi>Commiſſions</hi> were ſeen by Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi>

               <hi>who has writ at large to you by this Pacquet, we are all pleaſed with the hopes you give us of uniting all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, if this could be improved to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of collecting all their Sentiments, from time to time, into one Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by their Directions, it would have wonderful Effects here, and make all Anſwers expeditious and ſatisfactory.</hi>

            <p>Here are Directions how <hi>Crosby</hi> and his Accomplices are to proceed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to form a Deſcent from <hi>France,</hi> and an Inſurrection and Rebellion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all Parties muſt be cajol'd, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions humour'd and ſuch Promiſes made, as were never intended to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. That's the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Words, <hi>uniting all Intereſts,</hi> for according to the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſettled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, if they could Re-inthrone the late King <hi>James, none but the Papiſts muſt be ſharers in the Government, or in their Kings Affection or Bounty;</hi> for they equally hate all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under what Denomination ſoever, as I will prove by their own Words and Matter of Fact: It being one of their own deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101173:43"/>berate Advices, at a Conſult, and ſent to the late King <hi>James</hi> as a Rule to govern himſelf by, <hi>viz. That he ſhould make uſe of the Whigs but never trust them,</hi>

            <p>In the laſt Letter produced, <hi>Crosby</hi> had Orders from <hi>France</hi> to inform himſelf of the Sentiments of the whole Party, and digeſt them into one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            </p>
            <p>This Paragraph that ſo loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims a Plot againſt the Government, and humbly begs help to ruin their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, gives us the true Effigies of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who repreſented our Affairs to the <hi>French,</hi> not as they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were; but after ſuch a manner as might tempt the <hi>French</hi> King to aſſiſt them; but the <hi>French,</hi> it ſeems, had more Kindneſs for themſelves, then to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101173:48"/>be again deluded by their repeated Falſifications; and therefore would neither credit their Aſſurances, nor comply with their Requeſts, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding 30000 Soldiers, and a Fleet of Ships and Seamen, for <hi>Moon-ſhine'ith Water;</hi> having lately ſound by a dear bought Experience, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen and Soldiers were not ſo <hi>few,</hi> nor ſo <hi>falſe,</hi> nor the Nation ſo <hi>poor,</hi> nor ſo <hi>factious;</hi> but that they were always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre'd to be irreconcileable Enemies to all that were ſo to King <hi>William</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and being ſo united, would exert their Courage and Fidelity, and <hi>Chaſtiſe</hi> the Inſolency of all that oppos'd them at their Pleaſure; as a late Event had already juſtified. Now,</p>
            <p>That this ſolemn Invitation had no Effect, was not want of Will, but Power in the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> ſince they puſht it ſo far, and made it ſo public, and is not this Project enough to aſtoniſh all that conſider the Deſign, and its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. That the <hi>Jacobite</hi> having devour'd the <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> a Monſter ſhould grow up in the room of him; who cares not if Great <hi>Britain</hi> might but be <hi>Loſt,</hi> who gains it; ſo our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

And that ſo <hi>England</hi> be but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,</hi> they are neither afraid, nor aſham'd, to ſee it accompany'd with the Deſolation of our <hi>Cities,</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of our <hi>Temples,</hi> converting the <hi>whole</hi> Land into one Forreign ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Houſe, and leaving a rich and fertile Kingdom to be poſſeſs'd by a pack of <hi>beggarly, hunger-ſtarv'd, naked Slaves and Vaſſals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be added upon this Head, if the Author could take any Pleaſure in ſo melancholy a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And that it were not to make little Account of the Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men to whom he writes, that he did not think them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reſenting the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and were not of <hi>Ability, Skill and Honesty,</hi> to countermine them, and all their Confederates.</p>

                     <hi>WE no ways doubt but his Moſt Chriſtian Majesty is fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the King, who has had laid

As to the propereſt Place, the Time, the Number requiſite, and the Concurrence to be expected from hence upon a Deſcent: But becauſe the beſt and moſt ſolid Concluſions are drawn from an Union and Harmony in Opinion, we think it not amiſs to explain our ſelves upon that Head, to the end, that if ours agree with thoſe you have already before you, it may have the greater weight with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>then, as to the Number, it's our Opinion and that of all we converſe with, that</hi> 30000 <hi>Men, or</hi> 25000 <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> 5000 <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>would carry the King through all difficulties, will be a ſufficient ſhelter for his Friends, and an Encouragement to others to come into him, and declare for him, that ſuch an Army, or a much leſs, according as the Army here riſes or falls, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who conveys this, and has concerted it with us, will be able further to explain unto you, ſeconded with an agreeable Miniſtry, and the Kings late gratious Declaration, would meet with little Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

            <p>
               <hi>Briſtol,</hi> it's true, might be repreſented by that turbulent Man Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> who held Correſpondence with <hi>Crosby,</hi> to be in the late Kings Intereſt, but if he had put it to the Tryal, he would have found a vigorous and ſturdy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: The ableſt Merchants and greateſt Traders in the Town being all <hi>Williamites,</hi> as appear'd at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Citizens to ſerve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they threw out Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Hart,</hi> from being Members of Parliament by a great Majority.</p>
            <p>What they ſay of the Towns of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> and <hi>Weymouth</hi> in particular, I am well aſſured is wholy falſe, for they are both known to be <hi>univerſally</hi> well affected to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101173:55"/>and few, if any Towns, in the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſo entirely: For there are not in either of them above <hi>three Jacobites,</hi> and thoſe in no <hi>Credit,</hi> but diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and contemned by every Body for being ſo. I wiſh I were as able to do Juſtice to other Places and Perſons, as a worthy Gentleman hath made me in this. And now,</p>
            <p>What need is there of producing <hi>Lunt, Womball</hi> or <hi>Wilſon</hi> for further Proof of a Plot in general, or of a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Plot in particular, when the Managers of the whole Party ſay, <hi>that there were in the</hi> North <hi>four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men actually listed for the Service of the late King</hi> James, <hi>and were ready to march upon Occaſion, and would be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Men of great Conſideration.</hi> For the Kings Evidences have ſaid no more than what is here confeſt by the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Papers do alſo give you an Account of the State of our Fleet, and of the Inclination of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons in the Government, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or diſaffected (if you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them) all which I find in Letters taken in <hi>Crosby</hi>'s Cuſtody dated 22d,

            <p>Whileſt <hi>Taffe</hi> was in the Country I muſt not forget to acquaint my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that tho' he ſeemed very <hi>Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and might have been much more uſeful than he was, in finding <hi>concealed Arms</hi> and <hi>Perſons (if he had been Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and had made more uſe of his Head,

            </p>
            <p>At Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> of the Lodge, he ſeized <hi>a great Sum of Money,</hi> and had carryed it off, if he had not been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly hinder'd by one of the Kings Meſſengers; however tho' he loſt the great Prize, which was thought to be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101173:70"/>near a <hi>thouſand Pound,</hi> he found an opportunity of playing a ſmall Game, and <hi>ſtole</hi> from thence alſo <hi>a Silver Chalice, an Altar Cloth, five or ſix Damask-Napkins, and a walking Cane,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Moriſco</hi> the Kings Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>with a little rough handling</hi> made him reſtore again to the Owner: Theſe and other his ſcandalous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours every where, was the only Reaſon that Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baker, ſleighted</hi> and <hi>contemn'd</hi> him, as unfit to intermeddle in any <hi>public</hi> Buſineſs, which he perceiving, took up Reſolutions to provide for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>and make his Fortune among the Jacobites.</hi> However, to make a fair Shew, and ſeem what he was not.</p>
            <p>Soon after he came to <hi>London,</hi> he waited on my Lord <hi>Bellemont,</hi> gave his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> an Account what Perſons and Arms had been ſeiz'd, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen had made their eſcapes, and that others abſconded, and fled from Place to Place, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereupon my Lord <hi>Bellemont</hi> asked <hi>Taffe, if this was the Buſineſs</hi> Lunt <hi>had diſcovered.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101173:70"/>had been with them in the Country, was very well known at the reſpective places he had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in his Depoſitions; and had done greater Service at his being there, <hi>if the</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>Gentlemen had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved notice from</hi> London <hi>of their coming ten days before they came to</hi> Standiſh-Hall.

            <p>This Account being given to my Lord <hi>Bellemont, Taffe</hi> addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Mr.</hi> Aaron Smith <hi>and Captain</hi> Baker, for the Reward of his Service, but finding himſelf <hi>ſlighted and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for his ſcandalous Behaviour,</hi> and (as he thought) not ſufficiently rewarded for his Journey into <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> he grew very angry and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Revenge upon the Government <hi>even to the ſpoiling of the Plot,</hi> as he pleaſed to call it, and, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Ruin of all thoſe that were concern'd in it, particularly of Mr.

               <hi>Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> who had dealt ſo ungratefully by him.</p>

               </note> Mr. <hi>Wybrand</hi> deſires <hi>Taffe</hi> to be ingenious with him, and tell him, whether he was concerned in the Plot, for he heard it would come to nothing. <hi>Taffe</hi> replies, <hi>he was no Evidence nor knew any thing of the Plot himſelf; but he knew there was good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences againſt the Priſoners, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> (as he worded it) <hi>to hang them all; but if he could ſpeak with any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101173:71"/>Friend of Mr.</hi> Legh's, <hi>he might get a good Summ of Money and make his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by telling him away how to ſave all their Lives;</hi> but <hi>Taffe</hi> after further Diſcourſe, finding this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Wybrand</hi> not for his purpoſe, he leaves him; but gives not over his Search, till he is firſt met by Mrs. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> Wife to one of the Priſoners, and afterwards by Mr. <hi>Banks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beresford,</hi> who were Freinds, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as they demean'd themſelves, <hi>were thought Solicitors for all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101173:72"/>But the Certainty of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi> and how much it amounts to, I cannot yet learn, tho' I have reaſon to believe <hi>it is conſiderable,</hi> ſince Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> told his Couſin <hi>Barker</hi> at the Tryal at <hi>Mancheſter, that

               <hi>that the Priſoners at the Bar had received Commiſſions from the late King</hi> James, <hi>to raiſe War againſt their preſent Majeſties and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to that end had bought Arms, liſted and ſubſiſted Soldiers at their own Charge, and had frequent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the late King</hi> James <hi>for the carrying on an Invaſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, which having been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as to the Time, Manner and all other Circumſtances, I ſhall forbear a further Recital here, and proceed to tell my Reader, that whilſt the Kings Witneſſes were delivering their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, Sir <hi>W. W. (tho he afterwards treated the Priſoners Evidences with all imaginable Reſpect and Civility,)</hi> was obſerv'd to <hi>brow-beat</hi> them, and by <hi>croſs, impertinent and extraneous Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> foreign to the Matter in Hand, endeavour'd to <hi>baffle, puzzle, confound and entrap them, in what they Swore,</hi> but failing in that main Point of his Skill; he requires Mr. <hi>Lunt</hi> to point at the ſeveral Priſoners by Name: In doing which, ſome ſay he pointed at
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101173:74"/>the <hi>wrong Man,</hi> tho' they were ſo <hi>hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> and <hi>crowded</hi> together, it was hard to ſay which was the Perſon he pointed at; however this gratified the <hi>Popiſh Mob,</hi> and raiſed a loud <hi>Laugh:</hi> But their Mirth continu'd not long; for one of my Lords the Judges commanding <hi>Lunt</hi> to Touch and Name all the accuſed Gentlemen <hi>with the Cryers Staff, he named them all Right,</hi> nor had it been Material (in my Opinion) if he had been Guilty of a <hi>Miſnomen,</hi> ſince <hi>Lunt</hi> had ſaid upon Oath, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw <hi>that Gentleman but once, which was in the Night too, and that alſo 'twns two Years ſince be ſaw him,</hi> that was pretended to be miſnamed.</p>
            <p>However it gave Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>(tho he was then one of the Kings Counſel)</hi> to ſhew which ſide he was on now as well as at the Tryal of my Lords the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>The Kings Witneſſes having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Evidence againſt the Priſoners, and all <hi>agreeing with one another as to Matter of Fact;</hi> Witneſſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for the Priſoners, to invalidate the Teſtimony of thoſe who had Sworn for the King; and ſuch a Noiſe had the <hi>Jacobites</hi> made with <hi>theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:101173:74"/>that greater Matters were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them, than perform'd by them, for at length their mountainous Boaſting was deliver'd of a ridiculous Mouſe. All that their Witneſſes ſaid, was only accuſing the Kings Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſome petty Immoralities, that they pretended to have gather'd from their own Mouths, in <hi>Ale-Houſes</hi> and at other <hi>Compotations; but not one Word in diſproof of what they had ſworn againſt the Priſoners.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But that which (I ſuppoſe) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with the <hi>Jacobites</hi> to inſtruct theſe Witneſſes no better, was the great Dependance they had on <hi>Taffe,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101173:75"/>and the ſtreſs they laid upon his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which in ſhort was, <hi>that there was no Truth in the pretended Plot, the whole being a villainous Contrivance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and</hi> Lunt.</p>
            <p>Or rather to ſpeak Truth was a wicked Contrivance between <hi>Taffe</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Beres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to ſhamm the Plot, and acquit the Gentlemen accuſed; for if <hi>Lunt</hi> was as bad a Man as <hi>Taffe</hi> would render him, it no way deſtroys the Reality of the Plot (which to the eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of them that contriv'd to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule it, or defend the Plotters) will remain <hi>True</hi> and ſtand as firm as a Rock (notwithſtanding all the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the <hi>Jacobites</hi> can raiſe to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it) <hi>if there was no ſuch Man in the World as Mr. Lunt.</hi> And this I ſhall further prove, when I have taken leave of this Father <hi>Vincent, Thomas O Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, John Taffe, Teague O Devilly,</hi> who for making his Fortune has confeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of the greateſt Villains in the World, nay to gratify his <hi>Lancaſhire Benefactors,</hi> has made himſelf a greater Rogue than he was in attributing ſuch Helliſh Contrivances to his own, and <hi>Lunts</hi> Invention, <hi>which was only a Calumny

            </p>
            <p>Some Men undergo hard Cenſures in the World from the ill Character given them by their <hi>profeſt Enemies,</hi> out of Malice and Hatred, and theſe are to be <hi>pittyed</hi> if not wholly <hi>excuſed;</hi> but for the Man that calls himſelf the worſt of Men <hi>(and that in ſolemn Judicial Proceedings where his Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ought to have equal Credit with an Oath,)</hi> there is no Apology, for tho' it deſtroys what he ſays of another, <hi>'tis the beſt Evidence in the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf,</hi> and will be ſo eſteemed by all Mankind: And yet this Mans <hi>ſingle ſay-ſo without any Oath,</hi> contrary to the Oaths of twenty ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the King, which corroborate the Teſtimonies of ten poſitive Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that diſcover'd the Plot, was all the ground the <hi>Jacobites</hi> had to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi> it and <hi>rail</hi> againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for proſecuting the Offenders, and call the <hi>Plot</hi> a ſhamm-Contrivance of ſome little Miniſters to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ruin of the Perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; tho' now that Calumny too is proved a <hi>meer Invention of the Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

            <p>Again, if Conſcience had been the Motive, why did he go ſo far in it? Why was he ſo active in ſeizing of

            <p>Again, if what <hi>Taffe</hi> ſays (in relation to Mr. <hi>Lunt's</hi> Evidence) had any kind of Truth in it, it no way anſwers the End for which it is deſign'd; for the Truth of the Plot does not (as I have ſaid before) depend only upon <hi>Lunt's</hi> ſingle Evidence, but upon the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mr. <hi>Kelly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodſworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cawſon</hi> and the Ships Company, the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe-Officers,</hi> and ſeveral Perſons of <hi>Quality</hi> and

            <p>So that the Plot in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King and Government could not be a Contrivance of <hi>Taffe</hi> and <hi>Lunt</hi> in 1694, it being thus credibly diſcovered, and Search made after the Conſpirators in 1690, whilſt Mr. <hi>Lunt</hi> was acting in it, and had been proſecured with effect then, <hi>if the</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites <hi>had not provided for their own Safety by removing Mr.</hi> Kelly <hi>into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other World;</hi> as not long after they ſerved Mr. <hi>Dodſworth</hi> by Murthering him as ſoon as they heard of

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101173:81"/>
               <hi>Fraud, Fallacy, Bribery</hi> and <hi>Barbarity,</hi> a Man would wonder with what Face they could impoſe <hi>Taffe</hi>'s Lies upon the World, or endeavour to baffle <hi>Lunt</hi>'s Teſtimony, which hath ſo many undeniable Witneſſes to confirm it. But,</p>

            <p>When the Maſter of the Veſſel brought <hi>Lunt</hi> and <hi>Thrillfall</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was apprehended and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>London</hi> for ſo doing, and by accident hearing of <hi>Lunt's</hi> being a Priſoner in <hi>Coventry,</hi> charged him to be one of the Perſons that brought thoſe Commiſſions from the late King <hi>James;</hi> which were found in his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; <hi>Whether that was of</hi> Taffe<hi>'s Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Lunt</hi> was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> upon the Oath of Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and the five Seamen for bringing over theſe Commiſſions, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (in great Danger of Hanging) committed to <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Goal for high Treaſon (where he lay three Aſſizes) <hi>Was that of</hi> Taffe's <hi>contriving?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:101173:81"/>When Mr. <hi>Thrillfall</hi> having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Commiſſions in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and being accuſed for it by Mr. <hi>Dodſworth,</hi> and like to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the <hi>Lancaſhire Militia,</hi> choſe rather to be kill'd than to be taken? <hi>Was that Mr.</hi> Taffe's <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was the Diſcovery of the Kettle-Drums that were bought by <hi>C.

            <p>If ſo I aſſure you Sir <hi>W.W.</hi> he is a very <hi>Wagg,</hi> and for ought, I know, <hi>that the Gentlemen when accuſed of high Treaſon and Priſoners in the</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>had by their Friends frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with, and Advice and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from, one that was then of the Kings Council.</hi> Before they conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower, might be of his Contrivance alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſince <hi>Taffe</hi> is <hi>ſo excellent at contriving,</hi> the very procuring Sir <hi>W.W.</hi> to be the ſole Manager of the

            </p>
            <p>However, <hi>a Contrivance there was,</hi> and tho' it does not effect <hi>Lunt</hi> (as they would have it) in forging the Plot.

            <p>This Politick Piece of <hi>Chicanery</hi> ſtrongly amazed the Kings Proſecutors, that one of the <hi>Kings Council</hi> ſhould ſo far influence the reſt, as all (but one) ſhould refuſe or neglect to let all the Kings Witneſſes he heard; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Bale</hi> the Kings Proſecutor (being put upon it by Captain <hi>Baker</hi>) <hi>prayed Sir</hi> W.

               <hi>Whether they would admit of the Tryals and Acquittals of the Gentlemen in</hi> Lancaſhire, <hi>without producing Records, Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which they unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed (being very deſirous of a Tryal) <hi>That they would, and for the eaſe of the Government, ſaving Expence, and that Truth might appear in a Legal Tryal, would alſo be oblig'd by a Rule of Court, not only to admit the Things there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Mr.</hi> Smith, <hi>but every Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Thing elſe, that might expedite their Tryals, ſave only owning themſelves guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having this Aſſurance of a Tryal, the Witneſſes took out <hi>Poſt-Warrants, beſpoke Subpoenas, and engaged Perſons to ſerve them;</hi> but when ready for their Journey, the Defendants had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from Mr. <hi>Attorney General Ward,</hi> that he could not try them that <hi>Term,</hi> it's ſaid he conſulted with ſome of the

            </p>
            <p>Now a new Scene appears, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of trying them upon the <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſpiracy,</hi> which above all things, one would think, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould have been moſt ſolicitous for.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Lancaster</hi> Aſſizes, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1695, <hi>the Gentlemen having a Grand-Jury wherein were four or five Perſons, which had never taken the Oaths of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to their Majesties,</hi>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101173:86"/>of High-Treaſon,</hi> was a Witneſs againſt them, <hi>upon the Indictment of Perjury;</hi> and then none will ſcruple believing, but they would <hi>acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and load their Adverſaries, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this advantage of being their own Compurgators.</hi> And ſo as it was laid, it happen'd, the Witneſſes were all found Guilty.</p>
            <p>This Advantage over the Innocent Evidences, ſo exalted the Party, they could not forbear expreſſing their Joy at it, by ungrateful Reflections upon his Majeſties Government in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Companies, and becauſe ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Government (they care not who) muſt always be blam'd as the Cauſe of their Trouble, ſome of the Party were ſo void of ſhame, as (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Witneſſes were convicted of Perjury) to tell the Honourable <hi>Judge Turton,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Macclesfeild,</hi> being Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> had ſent down thither great Quantities of Arms, and immediatly added this malitious <hi>Innuendo, and what if his Lordſhip deſigns thereby to entrap us.</hi> An Inference ſo full of <hi>Venom,</hi> and ſo wickedly <hi>Falſe,</hi> that nothing could be guilty of it, that had

            </p>
            <p>Next day after, the <hi>Defendants</hi> gave notice they would move the Court (tho they were told they could have no remedy there againſt the King) whereupon the Kings Managers, in the <hi>Attorney Generals</hi> Name, offer'd <hi>to pay the Defendants Coſts, if they would for bear the Motion,</hi> but the <hi>Defendants</hi> refuſed the Offer, and the Court was mov'd the next day; and Mr. <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General</hi> and <hi>Sergeant Gold,</hi> being ſent for into Court, the Court ask'd them, <hi>why they refuſed to try the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ſince there was a Rule of Court made the laſt</hi> Term <hi>for their being try'd in this?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Parliament was prorogu'd the 3d of <hi>May</hi> 1695, and the King ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>Flanders</hi> the day following, ſo there being no hopes of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their barbarous Deſign till his Majeſties Return, they reſolve ſo to employ the Summer, that Winter might find them ready to perform what they had ſo long and unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully reſolv'd on.

            <p>All the Aſſaſſins being come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that were expected from <hi>France,</hi> and their Number compleated by the Addition of others that were in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the execrable Deſign was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all the <hi>Deſperados:</hi> Some of which were <hi>ſtartled</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed</hi> with <hi>horror</hi> at the firſt Relation of it; but all the Scruples that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> could raiſe were ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by the <hi>Authority of the late King</hi> James<hi>'s Commiſſion,</hi> and their Phanciful Proſpects of Wealth and Honour, that would attend the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore all conſented to <hi>forfeit</hi> their Honours, and <hi>hazard</hi> their Lives in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:101173:97"/>Now ſeveral ways are propoſed by the Conſpirators to execute their long deſign'd Attempt againſt <hi>his Majeſties Perſon.</hi> Some propoſed the <hi>ſeizing his Majeſty and carrying him alive into</hi> France, <hi>and to that purpoſe a faint was made, that a Caſtle on the Sea-ſide was ſecured to detain the King in, till a Ship was ready to tranſport him thither;</hi> but the wiſer and more wicked among them, that underſtood what was meant <hi>by ſeizing the King's Perſon,</hi> laught at this as a meer <hi>Chimera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others propoſed, <hi>to kill his Majeſty at</hi> Kenſington, <hi>by attaching his Guards and forcing his Pallace in the dead of the night;</hi> but this upon debating was alſo thought wholly impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Some were for <hi>Murthering the King as he came on</hi> Sunday <hi>to St.</hi> James<hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and for this purpoſe forty Men well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med were to Aſſault his Majeſties Guards, which commonly do not exceed above twenty five, while ſix Men on Foot ſhould ſhut</hi> Hide Parke-gate, <hi>and the reſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate his Majeſty,

            </p>
            <p>Another Propoſal was, <hi>to Murther the King as he returned from Hunting, in a narrow Lane by a Wood-ſide, leading to the</hi> Thames <hi>on the other ſide of the Water, about a hundred and fifty paces long, in which there is a Gate that when 'tis ſhut, hinders Coaches, or Horſes, from paſſing that way:</hi> One of the Aſſaſſins was ſent to view this Ground, and another to view the Lane afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; but Sr. <hi>George Barclay</hi> who was to command this infamous Party did not <hi>approve that Lane,</hi> and the Difficulties that aroſe in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, cauſed that Project to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at laſt they fix upon a Place <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi> Brentford <hi>and</hi> Turnham-Green. <hi>In a bottom where the Ground is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh there is a Bridge where diverſe Roads meet, and croſs one another; on the</hi> North <hi>ſide there is a Road that goes round</hi> Brentford, <hi>and on the</hi> South <hi>a Lane that leads to the River, ſo that one may come thither by four ſeveral Ways. After you paſt the Bridge, the Road grows narrow, having on one ſide a foot Path, and on the other a tall and thick Hedge; and this Place was pitcht
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101173:98"/>upon for the Execution of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Deſign:</hi> And truly, if Heaven had not diſcover'd their Treaſons (all Circumſtances conſider'd) a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>Place and Time</hi> could not have been found out. For,</p>
            <p>His Majeſty very often return'd <hi>late</hi> from Hunting, and uſually croſt the Water at <hi>Queens-Ferry</hi> by <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> with no greater Attendance than <hi>five or ſix of his Guards.</hi> 'Twas alſo his Majeſties Cuſtom to enter the Ferry-Boat without coming out of his Coach, and as ſoon as he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on this ſide the Water, the Coach drove on, without expecting the reſt of the Guards, who could not croſs the <hi>Thames,</hi> till the Boat return'd to <hi>Surry-ſide</hi> to bring them over; and <hi>ſo the King muſt inevitably have fallen into the Hands of his Murtherers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of his Guards could have come up to his Aſſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was the Time and Place more cunningly and deviliſhly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>then their Men were diſpoſed of;</hi> for having ſecured ſeveral Places at <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Turnham-Green</hi> and in ſcatter'd Houſes thereabouts, to ſet up their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till the King ſhould return from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101173:98"/>Hunting, <hi>One of the Conſpirators was order'd to wait at</hi> Queens-Ferry <hi>till the Kings Guards appear'd in ſight on</hi> Surry-ſide <hi>of the Water, and then to give ſpeedy Notice to the reſt, to be ready at their reſpective Ports, while the King was croſſing the</hi> Thames. For this wicked end, they were divided into <hi>three Parties,</hi> which were to make their Approaches by <hi>three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways,</hi> one of which was to come from <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> another from the <hi>Lane that leads to the Thames,</hi> and the third <hi>from the Road that goes round Brentford.</hi> One of theſe Parties were <hi>to attack the Guards in the Front, and the other in the Rear, whilſt ten or twelve Men of the bloodieſt Sort were to aſſaſſinate his Majeſty in his Coach:</hi> And put a Period to that Sacred Life, whoſe Safety and well Being is a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the Common Enemy of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> as well as the particular Joy, Delight and Safety of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When their execrable Deſign was accompliſh'd, the <hi>Conſpirators reſolv'd to keep in a Body till they came beyond</hi> Hammerſmith, <hi>and there to ſeperate, and by ſeveral Roads haſten to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>and from thence to the Sea-ſide,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101173:99"/>where the ſudden Landing of the</hi> French <hi>might ſecure them from the Rage of the Multitude, and the Hand of Juſtice.</hi> Thus was the <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> to make way for a <hi>French Invaſion,</hi> and the Invaſion to ſhelter the Murtherers of our King and Country.</p>
            <p>Horſes were now the only neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wanting, and Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>

            <p>With this Account the late King <hi>James</hi> ſends the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> to the—, who not a little pleas'd, that a Deſign of his <hi>own Laying</hi> ſhould ſucceed ſo luckily, communicated it to the Folks about him, and after ſome time ſpent in diverting themſelves with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Duke of <hi>Berwick's</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> and eſcaping from thence, the—ſent the <hi>Duke</hi> back to accompany the late King <hi>James</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>This Diſappointment and Fears of a Diſcovery made <hi>Plowden, Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Sherborn</hi> decline the Action, and withdraw themſelves, but Sr. <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Sr. <hi>William Perkins,</hi> Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> concluding the Deſign was not diſcover'd, <hi>becauſe they were not taken up by the Government,</hi> had another Meeting <hi>February</hi> 21ſt, and there reſolv'd to execute their bloody Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on <hi>Saturday</hi> 22d <hi>of February</hi> 1695.</p>
            <p>The Forenoon of that Day was ſpent in a tedious Expectation of News, that the King was gone abroad; but inſtead of that Account, <hi>Keyes</hi> (one of the orderly Men, which they lodg'd at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to give them Notice when the King went out) tells them, <hi>that the Guards were all come back in a Foam, and that there was a Muttering among the People, that a damnable Plot was diſcover'd,</hi> and this unexpected News diſpers'd all the Conſpirators, and drove them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101173:100"/>to ſhift for themſelves by a ſpeedy Flight.</p>
            <p>Nor were their Apprehenſions of a Diſcovery groundleſs; for the Plot and the Progreſs that was made in it from time to time, had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by <hi>Richard Fiſher</hi> to the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl of Portland</hi> a conſiderable Time before any other Perſon diſcover'd it, and, <hi>as Things ripen'd for Action,</hi> his Lordſhip was acquainted with the Particulars.

               <p>ABOUT the Time when the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Gentlemen were brought Priſoners to Town, <hi>I</hi> met Mr. <hi>Taffe, I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> met Capt. <hi>Cottingham,</hi> who hop'd that you were not concern'd in the Plot, <hi>eſpecially against Mr. Legh of Lime;</hi> for he heard he was a very honeſt Gentleman, after which Mr. <hi>Taffe</hi> preſſed me two or three Times to ſpeak to Capt. <hi>Cottingham,</hi> if he could bring him acquainted with any Friend of Mr. <hi>Legh of Limes,</hi> ſome time after <hi>I</hi> met him in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where he told me he was mightily diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that <hi>Mr. Baker and Mr. Smith</hi> who was then walking in the <hi>Temple,</hi> did uſe him barbarouſly, for they would not give him any Money, not ſo much as would pay his Horſe-hire into the Country, <hi>but he would be even with them and ſpoil the Plot,</hi> and ſeveral Words to that effect, <hi>I</hi> ask'd him to be Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious with me, and tell me whether he was concern'd in the Plot, for <hi>I</hi> heard it would come to nothing. He told me he was no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence nor knew any thing of the Plot: But he knew there were <hi>very good Evidence, and enough to hang them all;</hi> and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ask'd me whether <hi>I</hi> could help him to a Friend of <hi>Mr. Legh of Lime;</hi> for he was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there was no getting to ſpeak
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101173:161"/>to him, but if he could get to ſpeak to a particular Friend of his, <hi>he could make his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and get a good Sum of Money by it, for he could put them in a way to ſave their Lives: I</hi> ask'd him how could that be, when juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he told me <hi>the Evidence was Good, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hang them all;</hi> he anſwer'd <hi>that was no Matter, for he could contrive a way:</hi> But when he found <hi>I</hi> was not inclinable, he ſaid, now <hi>I</hi> think on it, <hi>he would not be concern'd in it, for it would look ill for him to be concern'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, who had appear'd ſo much for it.</hi>
